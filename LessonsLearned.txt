- Time management is one of the most important aspect of a project's life. 
- Self-motivation is important when you know you have big work-loads and new information. But it is hard. Also rewarding when it works.
- Asking questions answers other questions and are a key-role in personal and professional development.
- Taking time to look at the others around you: how they think, how they ask questions.
- Trying to push yourself over your known limits might reveal something you did not know you could do or you would enjoy. 
- Working by one's self can be revealing. It might get hard, but it is nice when you observe you have good results for your own strugles. 
- Team work is rewarding when team work 'works' :) 
- Team work is hard when there is nobody assigned to organise the work. But it is nice to see when if you take action in hand, people cooperate. 
- It is very important to be nice to people. It can make magic happen. 
- Working is important, but knowing how to work with people is more important.
- Most important: having someone right to learn from. 
- Being happy you learned something new it does not mean you give up learning more. You start learning more. And more.
- Writing this "lessons learned" is a lesson learned.
