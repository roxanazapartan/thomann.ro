Short History of Thomann Bussines - Online Shop 

The Idea

In 1954, Hans Thomann Sr decided to quit his job as a travelling musician.
 Amongst other gigs he'd worked for a circus. He also had to take care of the family farm and 
 drove to WÃ¼rzburg (70 km) almost daily in order to study the trumpet.
 
In the 1960s, while taking care of the farm in Treppendorf, Hans Thomann Sr's hobby remained music, thus spending more
 time travelling and selling equipment to brass combos and other musicians. 
 
The wild 1970s filled their rooms with musical instruments, transforming it into a real showroom.
Following the 1980s' they started to actually live in a shop, the Thomann family house, which can be found today in its original shape. 

Starting 1996, Thomann started the early days of the Internet. It was the forst music store in Germany
with a website. At the beginngf, emails were printed out and delivered to the individual departments, 
who replied by post. Today, that wouldn't really be practical as they receive around 340.000 a day. :-)

In the following years, call centers appeared, at present 250 agents process order in 19 languages. 
New storage warehouses were built and in 2008 the new Thomann Online Store was released, 
with 2 new built-in data centre containing 160 own servers which meets demand of over 2 milion European customers.
Winner of Global E-Commerce Summit in 2011, Online Retail Bussines Awards Thomann is in a continuous 
development and on 24th of September 2015 the new Thomann APP was released,
on AppStore and GooglePlay, with over 500000 downloads.
